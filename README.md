# TrueTime - Functional approach to JS DateTime

Still under development. But DateTime should be functional.

## Purpose

JavaScript Date() is lacking, and is a constant source of bug. There are libraries on npm that attempt to solve the Date() problem,
but I feel some of them are too heavy, while some of them do not address the real issues that cause bugs. Here is my attempt to
solve it.

# Status

It is still under heavy development.
